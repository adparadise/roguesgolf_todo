This is a todo list app. A potential entry into the Ruby Rogues' Ruby Golf compo, with the goal of fitting a ruby app into a tweet.

To use it, put it in a file, let's say todo.rb. The commands are as follows:

List your active todo items:
    ruby todo.rb 
    > 1 exercise a bit


Add an item to your todo list
    ruby todo.rb get some rest
    > 1 exercise a bit
    > 2 get some rest

Mark an item as done
    ruby todo.rb 1
    > 1 # exercise a bit
    > 2 get some rest
